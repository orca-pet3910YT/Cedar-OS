# How to compile?

This is writen in x86 assembly and C and needs to be created specifically with **NASM**, by running:
`build.sh`

# How to run?

Usually you use **QEMU** to run it on a virtual machine, if you know scripting you could make a script to turn it to an IMG or ISO and load it in VirtualBox, VMware or even real hardware, but that's not recommended.
You use the command `qemu-system-i386 -fda build/boot.img -d int -D fresh_test.txt -M smm=off -no-reboot -no-shutdown
simrun` or `qemu-system-i386 -fda build/boot.img`
